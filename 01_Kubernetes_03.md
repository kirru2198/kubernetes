# Kubernetes Networking Overview

## 1. Internal vs. External Communication
- **Internal Communication**: Happens within the Kubernetes cluster. We use a **ClusterIP** service for this.
- **External Communication**: Happens outside the Kubernetes cluster. We use a **NodePort** service for this.

## 2. Services and Pods
- When we create a service, it helps route traffic to Pods.
- Pod IPs are not permanent; they can change. To manage this, a service creates an **Endpoint** that keeps track of the Pod IPs. This way, the service always knows where to send traffic, even if the Pod IP changes.

## 3. Creating NodePort Service
- We can create a **NodePort** service for external communication. This allows traffic from outside the cluster to reach your Pods.
- **NodePort** exposes a port on each node in the cluster. The default port range for NodePort services is from **30000 to 32767**.

## 4. Traffic Flow with NodePort
- Traffic from outside the cluster hits a node first.
- The traffic is then forwarded to the service.
- The service forwards the traffic to one of the Pods based on the target port.

## 5. Ports in NodePort Service
- **Port**: The port on which the service listens.
- **Target Port**: The port on which the Pod’s application listens.
- **NodePort**: The port exposed on the node to allow external traffic to reach the service.

### Summary
In simple terms, a NodePort service makes a port available on each node, and when traffic comes in through that port, the service directs it to the appropriate Pod. The ClusterIP service is for internal communication, while the NodePort service is for external communication.

# Security Considerations with NodePort Services
The main issue with using NodePort services in Kubernetes is security. When you expose an application through NodePort, you're essentially opening a specific port on your node, making it accessible to the outside world. This could be risky because you're revealing the node's IP and the open port, which anyone could potentially exploit.

## Alternatives to NodePort
Instead of using NodePort for external access, it's better to use a **LoadBalancer** service. A LoadBalancer creates a cloud-based load balancer (like AWS's ALB or NLB), which routes the traffic to the correct node and pod without exposing the node's IP directly. This adds a layer of security and simplifies management, especially when dealing with many nodes.

### Summary of NodePort vs. LoadBalancer
- **NodePort**: Exposes your node’s IP and port directly, which could lead to security issues.
- **LoadBalancer**: Hides the node’s IP, routes traffic securely, and simplifies management, especially in cloud environments.

# Understanding Pods and Containers
- **Pod**: An abstraction that can contain one or more containers. A pod is useful for grouping related containers that need to share resources and run together.
- **Container**: A lightweight, standalone unit that holds your application code and dependencies.

# Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)
Kubernetes offers Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) to ensure data persistence beyond the life cycle of containers or pods. This is important because, in Kubernetes, if a pod or container is deleted, the data stored in it could be lost. Volumes in Kubernetes help solve this issue by allowing data to persist even if the pod is deleted.

## Key Concepts
1. **PV**: A storage space or volume (similar to an EBS volume in AWS). When you create it, it is available but not attached to anything.
2. **PVC**: A request to claim that available volume. When the PVC is created, it binds to the available PV, changing its status from "available" to "bound."
3. **Size and Access Mode Requirements**: The size of the PVC should be less than or equal to the size of the PV, and the access mode of the PVC should match the access mode of the PV.
4. **Using PVC in a Pod**: After claiming a volume with PVC, you can use that storage inside a Pod. The volume is mounted at a specific location in the container, so you can store data there. Even if the pod is deleted, the data remains in the volume.

### Example Workflow
1. **Create PV**: This is your storage space (like an external hard drive).
2. **Create PVC**: This is your request to use that storage space.
3. **Create Pod**: Inside the pod, you reference the PVC and mount the storage where you need it.

### How Storage Class Helps
- **Storage Class**: A way to automatically create volumes when needed. It defines how the volume should be provisioned based on your request, making volume management more dynamic.

### Summary
1. **PV** = Storage space
2. **PVC** = Request to use the storage
3. **Pod** = Uses the storage by referencing the PVC

This approach ensures that data is persistent, even if pods are deleted or recreated.

# Moving Towards Real-World Applications
We will create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), which will automatically create a Persistent Volume (PV). This is called **dynamic provisioning**. 

## Storage Class Definition
- **API Version**: `storage.k8s.io/v1`
- **Kind**: `StorageClass`
- **Provisioner**: `kubernetes.io/aws-ebs` (for AWS EBS)
- **Name**: "standard"
- **Volume Type**: "gp2"

## Upcoming Topics
1. Provisioning the storage class.
2. Using ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Namespaces.
3. Understanding StatefulSets and Deployments.
4. Setting up the EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana).
5. Working with load balancers, and understanding concepts like affinity and tolerations.

## Final Notes
Before we end today, if you’re done with your EKS cluster, make sure to delete it to avoid charges. It takes about 5-10 minutes to delete, and I do this after each session to reduce my bill.

If you have any questions, feel free to connect with me on GitHub. I’ll respond when I’m available.

See you tomorrow!
