# Container Orchestration using Kubernetes
      # What is kubernetes?
        - Kubernetes is yet another software for container Orchestration 
        - it works exactly the same way as Docker Swarm does, but it has some added functionalities as well 

      # Features of Kubernetes? 
          - K8S has a lot of features and it has packed things which make it batter then then other container Orchestration tools, such as 
              - Pods - Pods are nothing but combination of containers -- like in docker swarms we use to have one container which use to be Orchestrated and then monitored, if it is live or not, but Pods is a new concept which is there in K8S.
              - Replication Controllers - for different kind of use cases -- so for different kind of use cases we can replicate containers accordingly and that is handled by the replication controller 
              - storage Management - how we can manage storage in K8S, how containers share storage is what storage management is all about
              - Resource Monitoring - this is also better then the other container Orchestration tools
              - Health checks - are better 
              - service discovery 
              - Networking 
              - Secret Management --- Secret Management is basically deal with how you deal with credentials (How you inject credentials in a container) --- so that is more secure in K8S and also
              - Rolling Updates --- how do you make updates to a container --- K8S, natively, supports Blue-Green deployment that is what we call rolling updates
