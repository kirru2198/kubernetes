 Tasks To Be Performed:
 1. Use the previous deployment
 2. Change the replicas to 5 for the deployment

Here is a **detailed solution** to scale your existing **NGINX Kubernetes deployment** from **3 replicas to 5**:

---

## üßæ **Assignment Tasks Breakdown**

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Use the previous NGINX deployment

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Update the number of replicas to 5

---

## ‚úÖ **Step-by-Step Solution**

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Option 1: Scale Using `kubectl scale` Command (Quick Method)**

This is the easiest and most direct way.

#### Step 1: Verify the current deployment

```bash
kubectl get deployments
```

Example output:

```
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           5m
```

#### Step 2: Scale the deployment to 5 replicas

```bash
kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=5
```

#### Step 3: Confirm scaling worked

```bash
kubectl get deployments
```

You should now see:

```
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   5/5     5            5           6m
```

You can also list the pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
```

You should see 5 running pods.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Option 2: Modify the Deployment YAML File (Best for GitOps / CI)**

If you are using a YAML file (`nginx-deployment.yaml`) for your deployment, update the `replicas` field.

#### Original snippet:

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 3
```

#### Change to:

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 5
```

Then apply the updated configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
```

Confirm the update:

```bash
kubectl get deployments
```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary of Commands

```bash
# View current deployment
kubectl get deployments

# Scale deployment to 5 replicas
kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=5

# Verify that 5 pods are running
kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
```
